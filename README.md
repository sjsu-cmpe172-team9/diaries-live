### Project Introduction

Our project is designed to keep live online diary entries in a more user friendly way. Users are able to log-in with a google account and are only able to see and access diaries if logged in. When logging in the user is brought to a dashboard of all the userâ€™s diary entries they had created. From there the user is able to create a diary entry; these entries may be made public or private as the user sees fit. A public diary entry allows other Diary Live users to freely read the diary entry but not edit any part of the writing, while a private entry is only available for the user themselves to see. All diary entries written by the user are editable by them allowing for the user to change or delete and of their own entries that they are necessary. Users are also able to see all public stories made by certain users just by clicking on their names and last but not least they are able to log out at any time with all their diary entries previously made still in their accounts.
